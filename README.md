## 🚀 Performance Testing with Locust

I design and execute **API-focused performance testing solutions using Locust**, ensuring applications meet scalability, reliability, and response-time expectations.

### What I Do with Locust
- Build modular user behavior scripts
- Simulate real-world concurrent traffic
- Execute load, stress, and spike tests
- Capture response time, throughput, and error metrics
- Integrate performance tests into CI/CD pipelines
- Generate HTML and CSV performance reports

### Typical Use Cases
- API scalability validation
- SLA and response-time verification
- Pre-release performance benchmarking
- Regression performance testing
