## 🚀 Performance Testing with Locust

I design and implement **Locust-based performance testing frameworks** focused on API reliability and scalability.

### What I Build Using Locust:
- Modular user behavior models
- Environment-based configuration
- CSV-driven test data
- Load, stress, and endurance tests
- Failure thresholds for CI pipelines
- HTML & CSV performance reports

### Typical Use Cases:
- API throughput validation
- Concurrent user simulation
- SLA & response time verification
- Pre-production performance benchmarking
